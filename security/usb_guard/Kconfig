	Enable a policy engine that blocks newly connected USB devices which
	expose potentially dangerous functionality until they are explicitly
	approved.  The guard rejects devices that present mass storage,
	communication, or vendor specific interfaces unless a matching
	vendor/product identifier pair is allowed via securityfs.

	The policy can be managed through the securityfs file
	/sys/kernel/security/usb_guard/policy.  Writing
	"allow <vid> <pid>" adds a permanent exception and "clear" removes all
	exceptions.  The current policy can be inspected by reading the same
	file.  Denied devices are automatically unauthorised and require
	manual approval before use.

	If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
